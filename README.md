# 7-1 reflections

## Key terms compressed and reflected into ways that my small brain can understand

- `const` : variable declare command, does not entirely mean "constant" but serves as so.
 can use (almost) whatever funny name I want for my variables (sum, num1, num2)
- "Divorce doesnt exist."
- `let` : works similar to const except the values declared arent permanent and can be reassigned
- `while`: loop code
> `while (count <= 10)` makes the code keep running until certain conditions

- index.js = where I actually write the code of the program

~note to self: first off get my program from my old computer and get it on here
second, install the stuff from .vscode and put that into my files~

- `return` lines must be on the same line as what I want returned. Figured it didn't take a genius to know that

- `strings`: in-code text written in quotes, also consisting of various bits. Can be declared with either double quotes, single quotes, or backticks as long as it is written clean
cannot be subtracted or divided like math, but can be added onto eachother, glued with addition.
- Javascript is so loose that I can assign any value or string that I want as long as

### Boolean values: Javascript's on and off switches in code form

-Logical operators can be applied to boolean values and put them to use
 example from sources:

1. `&&` the and operator, produces true value if both conditions are true
2. `||` the or operator, only need one true to put out a true value
3. (`!`) the not operator. a unary operator that flips the value and makes things confusing for everyonr
> !true actually means `false`,
> !false actually means `true`,
> How mind boggling


### BITS

a bunch of 0s and 1s made to represent data.
Code and data are basically a sequence of 0 and 1.
Values are chunks of bits utilized for information

Math is inevitable

Arithmetic: The fifth grade level that you can finally apply to something.
Javascript also has special numbners like `infinity`, `-infinity`, and `NaN` (not a number, which shows up if i try to make a calculation that cannot work such as dividing by 0)
